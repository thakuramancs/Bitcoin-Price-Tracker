# Bitcoin Price Tracker

A simple, single-page web application that displays the current price of Bitcoin. It features a currency selector to view the price in USD, INR, EUR, and GBP, with the price updating automatically every second.

## How It Works

The application fetches Bitcoin price data from a public API and displays it. Users can select their preferred currency from a dropdown menu, and the displayed price will update accordingly.

## Technical Aspects

This project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on client-side functionality.
